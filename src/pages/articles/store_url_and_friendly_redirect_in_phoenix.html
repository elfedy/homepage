<p>When we have an applcation with authorization/authentication functionality in place, there are some cases when we may want redirect a user to the url he was previously visiting before logging in. This article shows how use plugs to achieve that in Phoenix.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<p>We are going to use the following strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Always store the last url of a GET request in a session variable.</p></li>
<li><p>When a user signs up or logs in redirect him to that stored url.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Storing url in a session</h2>

<p>We want to store the url of every get request that is not related to creating a new user or a new session. For this example we will asume we have REST <code>user</code>, <code>session</code> and <code>password_reset</code> routes, such as the ones used by the <a href="https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth">phauxth</a> library. In this case, we would like to avoid storing the following routes:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    GET     /sessions/new       
    GET     /password_resets/new
    GET     /password_resets/edit
  </code>
</pre>

<p>For storing the url we are going to use session storage. Session storage only stores data until user closes the tab he is currently browsing. This makes the most sense for our use case as we do not want the user to log in and get redirected to a page he may have visited some days ago.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, we could write a <code>FriendlyRedirect</code> module that exposes <code>store_path_in_session/2</code> to act as a plug. In order to do that, the function needs to take a <code>%Plug.Conn{}</code> struct and an options variable as arguments, and return another <code>Plug.Conn{}</code> struct, to be passed to the next plug in the pipeline.</p>


<pre>
  <code class="language-elixir">
    defmodule MyApp.FriendlyRedirect do
      import Plug.Conn

      def store_path_in_session(conn, _) do
        # Get HTTP method and url from conn
        method = conn.method
        path = conn.request_path

        # If conditions apply store path in session, else return conn unmodified 
        case {method, storable?(path)} do
          {"GET", true} -&gt;
            put_session(conn, :firendly_redirect_path, path)
      
          {_, _} -&gt;
            conn
        end
      end

      defp storable?(path) do
        !(url =~ r/user|session|password_resets/)
      end
    end
  </code>
</pre>
<p>We can make the module available in the router by importing it in its corresponding function in <code>lib/my_app.ex</code>.</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-elixir">
    def router do
     quote do
       use Phoenix.Router
       import Plug.Conn
       import Phoenix.Controller
       import MyApp.FriendlyRedirect
     end
    end
  </code>
</pre>
<p>We then call the <code>store_path_in_session/2</code> function as a plug in the <code>:browser</code> pipeline of our router.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-elixir">
    pipeline :browser do
      ...
      plug(:store_url_for_login_retargeting)
    end
  </code>
</pre>

<h2>Redirecting</h2>

<p>Now that we are storing the url, we have to redirect to it when the signup is successful. Let&rsquo;s add a public method to our previously defined module that gets the stored path or gives a default if no stored path is found. </p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-elixir">
defmodule MyApp.FriendlyRedirect do
  ...
  def target_path(conn) do
    target_path = 
      get_session(conn, :login_retargeting_path) || 
      default_retargeting_path
  end

  defp default_retargeting_path do
    "/"
  end
end
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Then on sign up/log in, we would redirect to that path inside the corresponding controller action:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="language-elixir">
    redirect conn, to: FriendlyRedirect.target_path(conn)
  </code>
</pre>
